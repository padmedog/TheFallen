Survival: 
It is entirely possible to live off in the wild harvesting resources, gathering materials, growing crops and hunting down animals. 
Any sort of survival stuff is added entirely decided by the community.

Explore: 
This game takes players where they would like to go. 
The initial release map is set on "blank blank island"
but over the next few months, many more locations will arrive for players to explore depending on what the community wants to see. 
Currently the island has plenty of interesting locations to discover and loot.
